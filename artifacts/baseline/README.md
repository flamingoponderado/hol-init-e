# Baseline ROM — Certificate proved in HOL

The 950,336-byte ROM combines the 208-byte bootstrap, padding to native entry
`0x80000fec`, the checked 904,476-byte native compiler output, and initialization
data at `0x800df000`. The native image ends exactly at `0x800ddd08`, as required
by the fixed source-memory code-buffer header. The bootstrap copies the data
into zero-initialized RAM, sets the heap/stack pointers and source headers, and
jumps to native code.

`initBootstrap` checks encoding, assembler instruction admissibility, and
numeric layout. `initBaselineRom` proves the ROM length, exact native/data
placement, and `native_ends_at_fixed_buffer`. `initBaselineAdmission` proves
admission of the resulting submission. These theories passed clean builds for
this placement. Execution-proof details and remaining obligations are tracked
in `experiments/RESULTS.md`.

`initBaselineCertificate.baseline_certificate` proves the fixed challenge
statement `Certificate baselineRom Infinity`. Its clean build checks the full
compiler, bootstrap, installation, source refinement, and concrete stack bound.
The exported ROM matches the checked construction byte for byte.

A replayable article and positive end-to-end Python verifier run are still
outstanding. This directory is an artifact archive, not a ready-to-submit
three-file package.

Build the Certificate with:

```sh
python3 tools/build.py --hol /path/to/tested/HOL initBaselineCertificateTheory
```

The construction target is `initBaselineRomTheory`. Exported files are named
`bootstrap.bin` and `baseline-rom.bin` in the build directory. Integrity hashes
are in `manifest.json`; these hashes are external checks, not HOL theorems.
